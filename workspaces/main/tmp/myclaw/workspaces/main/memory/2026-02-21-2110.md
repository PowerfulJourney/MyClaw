- User preference:
  - When Exec/system errors happen, proactively explain root cause.
  - If fixable, auto-fix and rerun previous command, then report final status.
- Incident logged:
  - `git commit` failed due to missing git author identity (`user.name`/`user.email`).
  - Resolved by setting local repo identity and re-running commit successfully.
