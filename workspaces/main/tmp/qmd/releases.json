    "body": "## [1.0.7] - 2026-02-18\n\n### Changes\n\n- LLM: add LiquidAI LFM2-1.2B as an alternative base model for query\n  expansion fine-tuning. LFM2's hybrid architecture (convolutions + attention)\n  is 2x faster at decode/prefill vs standard transformers — good fit for\n  on-device inference.\n- CLI: support multiple `-c` flags to search across several collections at\n  once (e.g. `qmd search -c notes -c journals \"query\"`). #191 (thanks\n  @openclaw)\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Return empty JSON array `[]` instead of no output when `--json` search\n  finds no results.\n- Resolve relative paths passed to `--index` so they don't produce malformed\n  config entries.\n- Respect `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` for collection config path instead of always\n  using `~/.config`. #190 (thanks @openclaw)\n- CLI: empty-collection hint now shows the correct `collection add` command.\n  #200 (thanks @vincentkoc)\n\n## [1.0.6] - 2026-02-16\n\n### Changes\n\n- CLI: `qmd status` now shows models with full HuggingFace links instead of\n  static names in `--help`. Model info is derived from the actual configured\n  URIs so it stays accurate if models change.\n- Release tooling: pre-push hook handles non-interactive shells (CI, editors)\n  gracefully — warnings auto-proceed instead of hanging on a tty prompt.\n  Annotated tags now resolve correctly for CI checks.\n\n## [1.0.5] - 2026-02-16\n\nThe npm package now ships compiled JavaScript instead of raw TypeScript,\nremoving the `tsx` runtime dependency. A new `/release` skill automates the\nfull release workflow with changelog validation and git hook enforcement.\n\n### Changes\n\n- Build: compile TypeScript to `dist/` via `tsc` so the npm package no longer\n  requires `tsx` at runtime. The `qmd` shell wrapper now runs `dist/qmd.js`\n  directly.\n- Release tooling: new `/release` skill that manages the full release\n  lifecycle — validates changelog, installs git hooks, previews release notes,\n  and cuts the release. Auto-populates `[Unreleased]` from git history when\n  empty.\n- Release tooling: `scripts/extract-changelog.sh` extracts cumulative notes\n  for the full minor series (e.g. 1.0.0 through 1.0.5) for GitHub releases.\n  Includes `[Unreleased]` content in previews.\n- Release tooling: `scripts/release.sh` renames `[Unreleased]` to a versioned\n  heading and inserts a fresh empty `[Unreleased]` section automatically.\n- Release tooling: pre-push git hook blocks `v*` tag pushes unless\n  `package.json` version matches the tag, a changelog entry exists, and CI\n  passed on GitHub.\n- Publish workflow: GitHub Actions now builds TypeScript, creates a GitHub\n  release with cumulative notes extracted from the changelog, and publishes\n  to npm with provenance.\n\n## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-15\n\nQMD now runs on both Node.js and Bun, with up to 2.7x faster reranking\nthrough parallel GPU contexts. GPU auto-detection replaces the unreliable\n`gpu: \"auto\"` with explicit CUDA/Metal/Vulkan probing.\n\n### Changes\n\n- Runtime: support Node.js (>=22) alongside Bun via a cross-runtime SQLite\n  abstraction layer (`src/db.ts`). `bun:sqlite` on Bun, `better-sqlite3` on\n  Node. The `qmd` wrapper auto-detects a suitable Node.js install via PATH,\n  then falls back to mise, asdf, nvm, and Homebrew locations.\n- Performance: parallel embedding & reranking via multiple LlamaContext\n  instances — up to 2.7x faster on multi-core machines.\n- Performance: flash attention for ~20% less VRAM per reranking context,\n  enabling more parallel contexts on GPU.\n- Performance: right-sized reranker context (40960 → 2048 tokens, 17x less\n  memory) since chunks are capped at ~900 tokens.\n- Performance: adaptive parallelism — context count computed from available\n  VRAM (GPU) or CPU math cores rather than hardcoded.\n- GPU: probe for CUDA, Metal, Vulkan explicitly at startup instead of\n  relying on node-llama-cpp's `gpu: \"auto\"`. `qmd status` shows device info.\n- Tests: reorganized into flat `test/` directory with vitest for Node.js and\n  bun test for Bun. New `eval-bm25` and `store.helpers.unit` suites.\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Prevent VRAM waste from duplicate context creation during concurrent\n  `embedBatch` calls — initialization lock now covers the full path.\n- Collection-aware FTS filtering so scoped keyword search actually restricts\n  results to the requested collection.\n",
